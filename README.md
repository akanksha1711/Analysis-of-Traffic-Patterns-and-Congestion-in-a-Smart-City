## **Introduction**  
With rapid urbanization, managing traffic efficiently has become critical for enhancing mobility, reducing congestion, and improving the quality of life in smart cities. This project analyzes traffic patterns using a dataset capturing parameters like vehicle types, weather conditions, economic states, time of day, and traffic density.  

The goal is to uncover actionable insights to help city planners implement sustainable traffic management strategies.  

---

## **Project Overview**  
The **CityDynamics Dashboard** provides decision-makers with critical insights into traffic behavior. Leveraging **Kibana**, an open-source visualization tool, the dashboard evaluates factors like:  
- Weather conditions  
- Economic states  
- Vehicle types  

Interactive charts, maps, and dashboards enable effective data exploration and analysis.  

---

## **Key Objectives**  
1. Identify patterns and trends in traffic flow across various cities.  
2. Examine the impact of external factors (e.g., weather, economic conditions, random events) on traffic congestion.  
3. Propose actionable recommendations for sustainable traffic management.
