Introduction
With rapid urbanization, managing traffic efficiently in smart cities has become critical to enhancing mobility, reducing congestion, and improving the overall quality of urban life. This project focuses on analyzing traffic patterns and congestion using a dataset that captures diverse parameters, such as vehicle types, weather conditions, economic states, time of day, and traffic density.

The goal of this analysis is to uncover actionable insights to aid city planners in implementing sustainable and adaptive traffic management strategies.

Project Overview
The CityDynamics Dashboard is designed to provide decision-makers with critical insights into traffic behavior. It evaluates various influencing factors like weather conditions, economic states, and vehicle types. This dashboard leverages Kibana, an open-source data visualization and analytics platform, enabling users to explore and analyze data effectively through interactive charts, maps, and dashboards.

Key Objectives
Identify patterns and trends in traffic flow across various cities.
Examine how external factors (e.g., weather, economic conditions, random events) influence traffic congestion.
Propose actionable recommendations for enhancing traffic management and city mobility.
Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this study contains a multidimensional view of traffic behavior in smart cities. Below are the primary attributes analyzed:

Attribute	Description
City	The city where the data was recorded.
Vehicle Type	Types of vehicles (e.g., autonomous cars, drones, flying cars).
Weather Condition	Weather at the time (e.g., snowy, rainy, clear, solar flare, electroma).
Economic Condition	Economic status during data collection (e.g., recession, stable, booming).
Day of the Week	The day when the data was recorded.
Hour of Day	The time of day during data collection.
Speed	Speed of vehicles at the time of data collection.

Dashboard overview
Dashboard 1 Dashboard 2

The dashboard we created on ElasticSearch via Kibana provides a comprehensive view of key transportation metrics, including energy consumption, vehicle performance, weather impact, economic conditions, and traffic patterns. It features actionable insights such as monitoring energy efficiency through a gauge chart, analyzing speed and traffic density correlations, understanding the impact of weather via a treemap, and visualizing vehicle type distribution with a pie chart. Geographical insights are presented through word clouds and bar charts, highlighting city-specific trends, while time-based traffic analysis reveals peak-hour patterns for better scheduling. These metrics collectively enable data-driven strategies for optimizing transportation operations.
